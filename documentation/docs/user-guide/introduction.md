Monosi is a stand-alone platform for data observability and monitoring. Monosi ensures data quality by automatically monitoring your data stack for anomalies, alerting you of issues, and analyzing the root cause.

Monosi is on a mission to operationalize metadata and use it to improve existing data systems.

- **Profile & setup basic data quality monitors in minutes.** Built-in logic to detect common data quality issues and the ability to extend checks.
- **No-code, stand-alone full web application.** Fully supported user interface to improve user experience and allow for anyone to view the quality of the data they are using.
- **Automated, built-in scheduler & jobs.** Connect your data sources and start monitoring immediately. No complicated processes or setup.
- **Integrate & monitor your entire data stack.** Contribute and add to our growing number of integrations to collect & monitor your stack or use the existing ones.
- **Own your (meta)data.** Keep control of your data (no security compliance process as Monosi is self-hosted), own and use the metadata collected by Monosi for any custom processes or analyses.
