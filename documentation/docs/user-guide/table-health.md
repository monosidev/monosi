## Anomaly Detection

The current implementation to detect anomalies involves calculating a Z-Score over the data set. If the value is outside of 3 standard deviations, it is considered an anomaly.

If an anomaly is detected by a monitor, the returned output contains information about the table, column, value, and metric that is anomalous. If none is found, then no errors are reported.
