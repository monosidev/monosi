Monosi v0.1.0 Release

<!--truncate-->

---

Monosi's v0.1.0 release brings a new UI, ease of use & deployment, and much more.

### Web Application & UI

In order to use the Monosi application, a web frontend and server are provided to add data sources, receive alerts, and view data quality analysis of the monitors that are running.

## Automatic Scheduler

Built-in scheduling is provided out of the box with Monosi so that you can set it and forget it - until you receive an alert - or choose to view regularly up-to-date data at any time.

## Profiler

Built-in profiling allows for the automatic creation of data monitors and quality checks when a data source is added.

### Deployment

Deploying has been simplified with Docker and Docker Compose. All the necessary dependencies for Monosi to run are managed through Docker Compose, making it easy to start with just 3 commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/monosidev/monosi.git
cd monosi
make compose
```

## Integration Support 

Support for Snowflake, PostgreSQL, and Redshift has been added. 

You can also receive alerts via webhooks and Slack.

### Documentation

Documentation has been added to the project and is available at https://docs.monosi.dev


### Testing & Bug fixes

More tests have been added to ensure the reliability of the code. Furthermore, bug fixes and code changes have been made to make Monosi increasingly more stable.
