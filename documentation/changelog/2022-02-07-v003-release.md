Monosi's v0.0.3 alpha release continues to enrich the available functionality provided by the observability toolkit.

### Monosi Web Interface & Server

With the release of v0.0.3 comes a new interface for interacting with Monosi. A simple and robust web application can now be used to set up monitors on specific data sources and alert on anomalies.

Find more information on getting started with the Monosi web interface [here](/docs/user-guide/introduction).

### Docker Image Deployment

We have provided a Monosi [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/monosi/monosi) to run the new web interface and simplify deployment.

You can run the application via docker and deploy it accordingly with dockerfiles/compose/nginx config files. More information can be found [here](/docs/guides/quick-install).

```
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 monosi/monosi
```

### PostgreSQL Support

Monosi now supports PostgreSQL as a core driver. More information on setting up a Postgres connection for the CLI can be found [here](/docs/integrations/postgresql). To setup a connection in the web interface, simply navigate to the datasources page.

Along with adding PostgreSQL, the driver implementation has been refactored to simplify adding support for other datasources. [Open an issue](https://github.com/monosidev/monosi/issues) for the data source you want Monosi to support.

```
cat ~/.monosi/workspaces.yml

default:
  sources:
    default: 
      type: postgres
      user: <USER>
      password: <PASSWORD>
      host: <HOST>
      port: <PORT>
      database: <DATABASE>
```

### Slack Alert Integrations

Monosi can now send alerts to Slack channels when anomalies are detected (Web Interface only). Alerts are sent through [channel webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). More information can be found [here](/docs/integrations/slack).

The Slack alert format is still being determined. Join the discussion on how to format alerts in our [Slack community](https://monosi.dev/slack).

### Schema Change Monitoring

We have added a new monitor type for tracking schema changes (CLI only). If at any point a monitored table experiences a schema change, Monosi will alert on the anomaly. More information on schema monitors can be found [here](https://docs.monosi.dev/).

```
monosi:
  monitors:
    - type: schema
      table: snowflake_sample_data.tpch_sf100.orders
      columns:
        - name: o_custkey
          type: integer
          order: 1
        - name: o_orderdate
          type: date
          order: 2
        - name: o_comment
          type: string
          order: 3
```

### Driver Refactors & Bug Fixes

A driver code refactor was introduced with v0.0.3 to support easier development of database driver integrations.

Furthermore, bug fixes and code changes have been made to make Monosi increasingly more stable as we approach v0.1.
