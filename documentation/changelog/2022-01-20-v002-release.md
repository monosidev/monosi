Monosi's v0.0.2 release brings a number of compelling features to the toolkit, which we believe will be incredibly useful.

Dive into the features that we've introduced below, or take a look at past updates.

### Monosi Scheduler & Server

With the introduction of v0.0.2 comes a built-in scheduler and server. With this addition, users can run a single command to allow continuous monitoring of their data sources for data quality issues.

While other data quality packages require setting up complicated pipelines and regularly recurring checks, Monosi has added support for running your monitors on the schedule you define continuously.

### Monosi Profiler

The Monosi Profiler automatically profiles your database to suggest and create new monitors for you to run from scratch.

New Monosi users can run the profile command to instantly bootstrap their library of data quality checks and start monitoring in minutes.

### Custom SQL Monitors

We're constantly working on adding more data quality checks to Monosi. Accordingly, we've introduced Custom SQL Monitors so that you can write custom rules and thresholds for any query.

In the future, be on the outlook for additional monitor types for freshness, schema checks, distribution, and more.

### Bug Fixes

Bug fixes and code changes have been made to make Monosi increasingly more stable as we approach v0.1.
