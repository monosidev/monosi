## Reporting Issues

Bug reports help make monosi better for everyone. To create a bug report, [raise an issue](https://github.com/monosidev/monosi/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) using the "Bug Report" template. This template will provide you with a structure so we can best recreate the issue and promptly respond. Please search within our issues before raising a new one to make sure you're not raising a duplicate.

## Feature requests

[Raise an issue](https://github.com/monosidev/monosi/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) using the "Feature Request" template and make sure it's tagged as an `enhancement`. We love every idea. Please give us as much context on the "why" as possible.

## Development Environment Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository to your development machine & navigate into it
3. Start a python virtual environment `python3 -m virtualenv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Run `make init`
5. Install the current dev version by running `python3 -m setup.py install`
